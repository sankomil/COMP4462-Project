# COMP4462-Project: Visualisations of Song Features

This project is part of the COMP4462 course offered at HKUST during Sprin 19-20. The aim of this project is to find what influences 
our choices in music, especially the specific features and their values. 

To represent this, we have made use of three separate visualisations, each serving a different purpose. Each of these visualisation,
and their codes, are used to fulfill one of the three tasks we had laid out during the initial phase of the project. Inside the folder
for each task, you can read about the purpose of the task as well as well as the visualisation we have used to achieve it. 

All codes can be found under the respective folders.
